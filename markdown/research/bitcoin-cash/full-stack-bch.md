This is a guide to becoming a Bitcoin Cash (BCH) full stack developer. It's a deep rabbit hole and a long journey to mastering the full stack of BCH software to make modern web and mobile apps that speak directly to the blockchain. But first, lets start with the most basic question: What *is* a BCH full stack developer? What does that term even *mean*?

## What is a BCH full stack developer?
Let's start with a couple definitions:

- **Developer**: A person who writes software. Because the world of software is so large, most developers will distinguish themselves by picking a specific programming like JavaScript, Python, Java, or C#.

- **Full Stack**: Developers will typically specialize in *front end* development (like phone apps, web apps, or other things with a user interface (**UI**)) or *back end* development (web servers, desktop applications, anything not involving a user interface). A full stack developer is one who is proficient at both.

Let's start with the end goal and work backwards from there: A BCH full stack developer with the skills that businesses are willing to pay good money for can build a wallet application or some other application that talks directly to the BCH blockchain. It can reliably receive and send transactions. They are able to run and maintain the infrastructure required to support that application.

This guide will give you a road map to acquiring the skills necessary to become a JavaScript BCH full stack developer.
