This page contains the IPFS hashs to some of my favorite content uploaded
to the IPFS network.

## Wikileaks
It's important to syndicate the Wikileaks data trove so that the information isn't
lost or censored. Find out more on the [Wikileaks blog post](/blog/wikileaks).

## My Code Repositories
I've gotten in the habit of uploading the GitHub repositories I create to my
IPFS node, along with all npm repositories. This means people can access the
code *and* dependencies if either GitHub or npm go down. All the code I develop
is in JavaScript, and often includes packaging in Docker containers.

### Decentralized Publishing
These are developer tools that I've created to help with publishing content via
the IPFS network and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchain.

this is the 'front end' website template used to create this site. You can fork
it to create your own website. It includes all the prerequisites for syndicating
your site over the IPFS network.

is the 'back end' web server running on the Raspberry Pi pictured above (Here is a version for the Raspberry Pi). It serves the content in a conventional way, but also syndicates it over the IPFS and Tor networks.

the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) version of the above koa-ipfs-blog.

a tool used to publish the IPFS link on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain, using the
[Memo.cash](https://memo.cash/profile/178M7njZV8qHNTwczgfu4f4fGik4tqrSR4) protocol.
It's important to note that Memo.cash is just a site. The data can be accessed
[directly off the BCH blockchain](https://explorer.bitcoin.com/bch/tx/5b90d71c4c230ee419cecbceacd1165690e117d28a8441110e1df57023e13da0).

### JavaScript Development

A '*boilerplate*' is a code template that provides all the basic functionality
needed to start a new project. This is the boilerplate that I use any time I need
to create a back end REST API for some new app. It uses [koa](https://koajs.com/),
which is the 'spiritual successor' of [express.js](https://expressjs.com/). I've
added new features over the last couple years, and a lot of other projects are
forked from this repository.
