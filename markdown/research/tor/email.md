Email is one of the most fundamental pieces of identity on the internet. This
page contains a curated list of links to service providers that I've played
with. The goals I have in mind when looking at email providers are:

- Can I sign up for an account with Tor, or do I get stopped-out by Captchas and
other tor-unfriendly obstacles?

- Do I need a pre-existing email address in order to sign up for the service?

- If a paid service, can I pay with a cryptocurrency (preferably BCH)?

## Hosts Matching Above Criteria:

None. I have yet to find a single email host that meet the three criteria above.
If you know of any that do, please reach out to
me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/christroutner).

## Hosts Evaluated:

- [protonmail.ch](http://protonmail.ch) - Requires cell phone or use of Paypal or
Credit Card to verify humanity. Does not allow cryptocurrency.

- [posteo.de](http://posteo.de/en) - Cash payment option, but no cryptocurrency
payment option.

- [fastmail.com](http://fastmail.com) - blocks signup with a captcha.

- [kolabnow.com](http://kolabnow.com) - requires a pre-existing email address.

- [mailbox.org](http://mailbox.org) - blocks signup with a captcha.

- [mxroute.com](http://mxroute.com) - Requires a pre-registered domain name.
Maybe feasible after this hurdle is overcome?

- [outlook.com](http://outlook.com) - Requires a cell phone to receive text messages.

- [runbox.com](http://runbox.com) - blocks signup with a captcha.

- [openmailbox.org](http://openmailbox.org) - blocks signup with a captcha.

- [torguard.net](http://torguard.net) - Looked good at first, but kept
navigating me in circles without the ability to create or pay for account.
