The Raspberry Pi is an inexpensive, credit-card sized minicomputer that has gained
great popularity for education. It's also incredibly handy for creating digital
appliances. Here are some digital appliances I've built with them in the past:

- Chart plotter for my boat
- GPS tracker
- [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) personal cloud file-server
- [Bitcoin Cash full node](https://github.com/christroutner/docker-abc-rpi)
- [Bitcore Node and Insight API](https://github.com/christroutner/docker-bitcore-node)
- [Web server](https://github.com/christroutner/koa-ipfs-blog-rpi)
- [Tor relay node](https://www.linux.com/blog/intro-to-linux/2018/6/turn-your-raspberry-pi-tor-relay-node)

And several others. I love the 'appliance factor': knowing that a specific physical
object is performing a specific function and providing a specific service.

This section contains tips and tricks I've collected over the years for tweeking
and administering Raspberry Pis.
