Over the last couple months, I took the ideas presented in my article about building an [IPFS API](/blog/ipfs-api) and built a JavaScript library ([ipfs-coord](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ipfs-coord)) and instant-messenger chat app ([chat.fullstack.cash](https://chat.fullstack.cash)).

The technical ideas behind building an uncensorable, private, p2p API are complex. I've learned from experience that it's always better to *show* rather then *tell*, when it comes to complex ideas. I spent a couple days thinking about the simplest app possible, that would still demonstrate the basic concepts. The best idea I could come up with was an instant-messenger chat app. People have an intuitive sense of how such an app *should* work. And a chat app contains all the basic ideas behind an API. If two computers can exchange text, then they are one step away from an [RPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call) for exchanging commands and data.

This first video is a non-technical demo of [chat.fullstack.cash](https://chat.fullstack.cash). It shows how to use the user interface, how to chat publicly and privately, and the command terminal for interrogating the [ipfs-coord](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ipfs-coord) library.

This second video is intended for developers who want a walkthrough of the component parts, and how they fit together. I walk through each of the JavaScript libraries, talk about the primary features, and how the subcomponents are composed together.

## Parallel Research

Through the course of building this proof of concept, I continued to reach out to other developers, technologists, and open source teams. I've been concerned with reinventing the wheel. I don't want to spend energy solving a problem that has already been solved.

- I created [this thread](https://discuss.ipfs.io/t/looking-for-links-rest-api-replacement-using-ipfs/9650) and [this thread](https://discuss.ipfs.io/t/ipfs-replacement-for-rest-api/10054) on the IPFS discussion forum.
- I talked to the [Textile](https://textile.io) team and they have been doing some similar research, captured in [this GitHub Issue](https://github.com/textileio/go-threads/discussions/483).
- Also, reading through the [OrbitDB documentation](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db) and they hint at an IPFS-based API, but don't indicate anything as advanced as what I've built.

So far I haven't found any robust solution to the problem of building a generic, uncensorable API. But it is vindicating to see that this idea has occurred to other developers, and we're all converging on nearly identical ideas.

There are a couple major features that need to be added, and more unit tests need to be written, to turn the ipfs-coord library into a production-ready, uncensorable API. But at least 80% of the work to go from concept to production is now completed, with [this simple IPFS-based chat-app proof of concept](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmavDnC49va71VezCy8zVmKjvdiPBQ3ycAXjEUrMYgbwHN/).
