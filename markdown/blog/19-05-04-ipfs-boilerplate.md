And.... we have lift off! This blog is now live and being syndicated over the
IPFS network. Updates to the site are announced over the Bitcoin Cash blockchain
by publishing OP_RETURN codes using the memo.cash protocol
to [this BCH address and memo.cash account](https://memo.cash/profile/178M7njZV8qHNTwczgfu4f4fGik4tqrSR4).

The latest versions of the site can be viewed here:
- Normal web browser: [http://decatur.hopto.org:4102/](https://memo.cash/profile/178M7njZV8qHNTwczgfu4f4fGik4tqrSR4)
- [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/): [http://k2h7xxqcjzwsdj64.onion/](http://k2h7xxqcjzwsdj64.onion/)

But if you get the latest IPFS hash
from [this memo.cash feed](https://memo.cash/profile/178M7njZV8qHNTwczgfu4f4fGik4tqrSR4) or
[directly from the blockchain](https://explorer.bitcoin.com/bch/tx/c0e2956bb84ae07fbf2d8e414caf10e8bdded15db4c358ba71aa7743a821f51f), you can access
the website directly from the IPFS network or via any IPFS gateway. Here are a
couple gateways with older versions of this site:
- https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmNd2RBQgkps93g43sL6pJndkjyJMgShXyUMMe3gwzjyTW/
- https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/QmNd2RBQgkps93g43sL6pJndkjyJMgShXyUMMe3gwzjyTW/

This website is intended to work in conjunction with
this [koa-ipfs-blog](https://github.com/christroutner/koa-ipfs-blog) for serving
and syndicating content, and
this [memo-push](https://github.com/christroutner/memo-push) tool for announcing
content updates on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain.

- [Here is a non-technical video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNVyatwd5M) overview
of how governments censor content on the internet, and how decentralized publishing
tools can be used to circumvent it.

- [Here is a walkthrough video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ez9YXpu_Chs&t=971s) of
how to use this repository along with
the [memo-push](https://github.com/christroutner/memo-push) tool to publish a
website in a decentralized, censorship-resistant way in order to leverage the
[Streisand Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect).

I'll break up a lot of that information in the research section, when I have time.
