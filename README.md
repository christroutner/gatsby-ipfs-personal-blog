# gatsby-ipfs-personal-blog

This is IPFS-based website that I use to maintain a personal blog as well as
my research notes on different areas of technology like cryptocurrency, tor,
IPFS, and Bitcoin Cash.

This website was forked
from [this IPFS website boilerplate](https://github.com/christroutner/gatsby-ipfs-boilerplate).
It's intended to work in conjunction with
this [koa-ipfs-blog](https://github.com/christroutner/koa-ipfs-blog) for serving
and syndicating content, and
this [memo-push](https://github.com/christroutner/memo-push) tool for announcing
content updates on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain.

Want to start your own website?

- [Here is a non-technical video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNVyatwd5M) overview
of how governments censor content on the internet, and how decentralized publishing
tools can be used to circumvent it.

- [Here is a walkthrough video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ez9YXpu_Chs&t=971s) of
how to use this repository along with
the [memo-push](https://github.com/christroutner/memo-push) tool to publish a
website in a decentralized, censorship-resistant way in order to leverage the
[Streisand Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect).
